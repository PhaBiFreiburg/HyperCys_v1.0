## Features Collection
* Feature Collection from 3D structures (34 features)
    * Pocket profile (PP)
        * Fpocket
            * Fpocket(https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-10-168) was used to determine whether or not amino acids are located in detectable binding pockets, and only those cysteines located in pockets were retained. Druggability, hydrophobicity, and polarity were collected.
       * Depth 
            * Depth (https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/41/W1/W314/1111943?login=false) was used to calculate the depth of cysteine burial.
    * SASA-PKA profile (SPP)
        * The pKa and SASA values for each cysteine and its surrounding amino acids within 4, 6, 8, and 10 Å of cysteine were calculated using PROPKA 3 (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26596171/) and freeSASA (https://freesasa.github.io/), respectively.
    * Amino Acid Composition (AAC)
        * Total number of surrounding amino acid residues within 4, 6, 8, and 10 Å of cysteine was calculated, and also the respective number of polar and hydrophobic amino acids according to the hydrophobic/polar (H/P) classification by Kamtekar et al. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8259512/).
        * Canonical H/P patterning: ADEGHKNPQRST-CFILMVWY
* Feature Collection from sequences (46 features)
    * HyperCys utilizes DisPredict2 to extract sequence features.
    * DisPredict_v2.0 (http://cs.uno.edu/~tamjid/Software.html).
